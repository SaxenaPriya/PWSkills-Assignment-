        "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming is a computer programming language that uses objects in programing\n",
        "- It focuses on classes and objects instead of only functions.\n",
        "- It aims to bind data and function together that operate on them so that, it can't be accessed outside.\n",
        "- It helps in organizing code, reusing it, and making large programs easier to manage.\n",
        "- It implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- Class is a user-defined data type in OOPs. It consists of variables(data) and method (functions), which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.\n",
        "- It is like an blueprint or template which create objects.\n",
        "*Syntax:*\n",
        "```\n",

        "  # class body (attributes and methods)\n",

        "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",

        "```\n",
        "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details and showing only essential features.\n",
        "- Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods inside a class and protecting data from misuse.\n",
        "- Both of them are one the core concept of OOP where, abstraction focuses on design and encapsulation focuses on implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods are special methods with name starting and ending with double underscores. They help in customise how objects behave with built-in operations.\n",

        "- It allows for more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",
        "- It has the ability to make same operator or method work differently on the basis of data passed.\n",

        "- Encapsulation is achieved using classes and access modifiers.\n",
        "To declare a method or a variable as private or protected we need to use underscores(\"_' or \"__\") before the name of it.\n",
